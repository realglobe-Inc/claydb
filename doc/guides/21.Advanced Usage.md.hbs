### Adding Policy to Resource

ClayDB is basically an open-schema and has no restriction on each data structure.
However you can use [Clay-Policy](https://github.com/realglobe-Inc/clay-policy) to validate entities on resource.


```javascript
{{{read 'example/example-policy.js'}}}
```


### Syncing Lumps

Clay-Lumps are distributed nodes of ClayDB and can be merge one another.
sync command compare the each entities in every resources on lumps and merge records by id.

Sync policy is quite simple. The newer one overcomes order one.

```javascript
{{{read 'example/example-sync.js'}}}
```
